JavaScript for .NET Developers
===============================
Code in support of an introductory talk to .NET developers on what to expect when developing .NET client apps.

The PowerPoint slide deck is from a talk I gave at the Fall 2012 Dev Connections. 

I alternated between slides and this "application" running inside Visual Studio 2012 with PageInspector. The results display in PageInspector window on the left while the corresponding JS file is displayed in a text editor window on the right.

In this manner I can make changes to the code (e.g., move the PAUSE comment down to reveal more running code) and [Ctrl-Alt-Enter] to both save the file and refresh the PageInspector window.

Think of it as a poor man's jsFiddle. Why? If was all in jsFiddle originally. But wireless failed at the conference - no wireless, no jsFiddle for me. Fortunately I had a day's notice to move it into a Visual Studio solution ... and thus the code you see now.

Here's what it looks like when I'm in the middle of a change:

Best of luck with your presentation.
